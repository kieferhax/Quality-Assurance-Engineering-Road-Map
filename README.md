# **Quality Assurance Engineering Road Map**
In an effort to further my technical QA engineering skills, I wanted to create some kind of comprehensive study plan to help guide me in my learning.

I decided to create a list of requirements and responsibilities from 10 separate QA Engineer job postings on [Tokyo Dev](https://www.tokyodev.com) in Notion, then feed the list into the latest ChatGPT model, o1-preview.

Based on the provided responsibilities and requirements, I've crafted a comprehensive 16-week study plan to help you enhance your technical skills as a QA Engineer. 

This plan covers essential areas such as test strategy development, manual and automated testing, web technologies, version control, CI/CD, performance testing, and more.
